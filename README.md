# SAP YaaS Analytics Extension
==========================================================

YaaS is a cloud platform that allows everyone to easily develop, extend and sell services and applications. YaaS exposes REST Based APIâ€™s with OAuth 2.0 authorization.
SAP Lumira supports consumption of different data sources to create data sets but does not support REST based web services with OAuth 2.0 functionality.

This extension is built with the version 2 Lumira Data Access Extension SDK.
